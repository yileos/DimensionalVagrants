Just some ships for now. You don't need the console commands anymore to find them in game. Most of them can be found as rare blueprints. Here are the Hullid's in case you want to spawn them anyway: 

redhull

archeon

cromen

pride

DvTraverser

DvTridentus

Dvfuri

DvUltrafuri

DvLongellus

DvAstratum


Not sure how to mark it as such on github yet but I consider this(the mod) open source and anyone who wants to make their own version of it is welcome to
