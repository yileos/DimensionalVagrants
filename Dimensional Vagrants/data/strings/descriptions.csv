redhull,SHIP,"A private collectors own custom built ship, designed to be capable of facing a vast majority of threats by itself.",Starskippin,,,,
Archeon,SHIP,"Of unkown origin, this ship was found on one of the outer edges of the sector. Now in mass production due to it's impressive capabilities and unusual but powerful design alterations. It's venting capabalities are extremely limited, in favour of an expirmental subsystem with unparalleled levels of Flux capacity. Overload is often preferred as result",,,,,
Cromen,SHIP,"Once a derelict hull discovered adrift in the Persean Abyss, the Omen Ascendant was rebuilt by a fanatical splinter sect of the Luddic Path. Said to house a ""divine intelligence,"" its terrifying design and erratic but devastating energy bursts have led some captains to avoid engagements out of superstition alone.",,,,,
DvTraverser,SHIP,"No one knows who built the Traverser. Its organic curves and non-standard hull composition suggest non-human originâ€”or worse, rogue Domain experimentation. Appearing seemingly out of folds in realspace, it phases unpredictably and vanishes without a trace. Many dismiss it as a ghost ship. The Hegemony disagrees.",,,,,
Pride,SHIP,"A relic of the Eos Exodus fleet, this golden behemoth was built to inspire as much as destroy. The lion-faced plating hides a brutal array of point-defense arrays and energy capacitors. It serves as both a warship and propaganda piece. ",,,,,
DvTridentus,SHIP,"A masterpiece of unknown origin, the Tridentus was designed as a prototype interdiction vessel capable of locking down entire fleets. Its crescent arms house flux-stabilizing coils, while its forward lances tear through armor with clinical precision.",,,,,
DvFuri,SHIP,"A light destroyer, the Furi is agile and fast, built for pack hunting. ",,,,,
DvUltrafuri,SHIP,"Furi upgraded, with a little bit more strength in almost every field. ",,,,,
DvLongellus,SHIP,A long-range strike cruiser that utilizes a vast arsenal of energy weapons and systems to enhance their output.,,,,,
DvAstratum,SHIP,"A capital ship, its presence bends sensor data and disables command relays across vast distances. It generates fractal interference patterns that scramble AI logic trees, making it particularly hated by remnants. ",,,,,
